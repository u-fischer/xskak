Run TeX/LaTeX on xskak.ins to unpack the dtx.

Put the three extracted files in tex/latex/xskak/.

The dtx-file doesn't contain any documentation.
So running LaTeX on it makes no sense!

Put xskak.pdf in
 doc/latex/xskak/

Update the filename database

DOCUMENTATION

xskak.pdf. There isn't a source for the documentation as it use some
local fonts and styles.

DESCRIPTION

The main point of xskak is to save informations about a chess game
for later use e.g. to loop through a game to make an animated board.
It also extend the input that the parsing commands can handle and
offer an interface to define and switch between indefinite levels
of styles.


REQUIREMENTS
xskak uses some primitives of e\TeX. It needs version 1.4 of skak,
a recent version of chessfss and xkeyval, version 1.5 of chessboard (which in turns
needs xifthen and pgf).
